Aquilia Model Signals -- pre/post save, delete, init hooks.

Provides a lightweight signal/event system for model lifecycle events,
with support for weak references, priority ordering, sender filtering,
and temporary connections.

Usage:
    from aquilia.models.signals import pre_save, post_save, pre_delete, post_delete

    @pre_save.connect
    async def hash_password(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        if sender.__name__ == "User" and instance.password_changed:
            instance.password = hash(instance.password)

    @post_save.connect
    async def send_welcome_email(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
        if created and sender.__name__ == "User":
            await send_email(instance.email, "Welcome!")

    A signal that can be connected to receiver functions.

    Receivers can be sync or async callables. They receive:

    Features:
        - Sender-based filtering
        - Priority ordering (lower runs first)
        - Weak references (auto-disconnect when receiver is GC'd)
